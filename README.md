# VBA-Challenge

This is an example of stock analysis using Visual Basic. Here I have summarized the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each individual stock across three years, running the analysis across sheets concurrently. I have also determined which stock had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and total stock volume per year.
